Design a genetic algorithm to solve the polynomial fitting problem that we did in Homework #1. 
You need to implement a genetic algorithm using BOTH mutation AND crossover operations. You 
need to decide a mutation rate and a crossover rate.  
 
Plot the following in one figure: 1) the original noisy data, 2) the polynomial you obtained in 
Homework  #1,  and  3)  the  polynomial  obtained  from  this  implementation.  Compare  and 
discussion the difference in performance of the two polynomials obtained with two different 
methods.
